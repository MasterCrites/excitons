Itinerary:
 0) Play around with Tight Binding Approximation (TBA) module.
 1) Start with Tight Binding Approximation to get ideas behind conduction.
 2) Try to encode excitonic behavior.
 3) Profit.
 4) Try to encode biological disorder to take advantage of the combination of localization
    and delocalization.
